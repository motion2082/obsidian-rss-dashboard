# Development Log

## 2026-03-24 — Session 9: Orphaned Items Bug Fix

### YouTube Feed Not Updating (Orphaned Items Logic Broken)
- **Problem**: YouTube feeds appeared to stop showing older videos after refresh. Items that had previously been stored (e.g. videos from Feb 27–Mar 6) would be silently dropped on the next refresh because they're outside YouTube's 15-item RSS window. With `maxItemsLimit = 25`, users would see the feed count drop from 25 to 15 after a refresh.
- **Root cause**: The orphaned-items retention loop in `parseFeed()` checked `!existingItems.has(itemGuid)` — but `existingItems` is a Map built from the *current stored items*, so every existing item always matched. The condition was always `false`, meaning no items were ever preserved from outside the new feed window.
- **Fix (feed-parser.ts)**: Added a `fetchedGuids` Set that collects the GUID of every item in the newly fetched feed. The orphaned-items loop now checks `!fetchedGuids.has(itemGuid)` instead — correctly preserving stored items that are no longer in the RSS window.

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/services/feed-parser.ts` | Fixed orphaned-items retention: check against `fetchedGuids` (new feed) instead of `existingItems` (stored items) |

## 2026-03-16 — Session 8: YouTube Stats, Reader Image Fixes, Discover Cleanup

### YouTube View & Like Counts on Cards
- **Problem**: YouTube cards showed no engagement metrics — just title, feed name, and thumbnail.
- **Fix (media-service.ts)**: After fetching playlist items via YouTube Data API v3, added a batch `videos?part=statistics` call (up to 50 video IDs per request) to retrieve `viewCount` and `likeCount`. Stats are stored on each `FeedItem` and updated on every feed refresh.
- **Fix (types.ts)**: Added `viewCount?: number` and `likeCount?: number` to `FeedItem` interface.
- **Fix (article-list.ts)**: Added `formatCompactNumber()` helper (e.g. 1.2M, 45K). YouTube cards now display eye icon + view count and thumbs-up icon + like count in the meta row.
- **Fix (card-view.css)**: Added `.rss-dashboard-video-stats` and `.rss-dashboard-video-stat` styles.
- **Note**: Only works when a YouTube API key is configured. RSS-only feeds don't include stats.

### Reader View Image Optimization
- **Problem**: XDA and other image-heavy feeds loaded full-resolution images in the reader, causing slow rendering and oversized images filling the viewport (e.g. hero images and author headshots).
- **Fix (reader.css)**: Added `max-height: 400px` and `object-fit: contain` to `.rss-reader-article-content img` to cap inline images.
- **Fix (reader-view.ts)**: Added `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` attributes to all content images for deferred loading. Added fade-in transition: images start with `opacity: 0` (class `rss-reader-img-loading`) and transition to `opacity: 1` on load.
- **Fix (reader.css)**: Added `.rss-reader-img-loading` class with `opacity: 0` and `transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in`.

### Discover Feed Cleanup
- **Problem**: Discover tab had 207 curated feeds across many unrelated categories — too much noise.
- **Fix (discover-feeds.json)**: Trimmed to 36 focused feeds covering tech news, AI, dev tools, Linux/open source, PKM, cybersecurity, tech podcasts, and xkcd.

### BRAT Release (2.2.0-motion.2)
- Bumped version, tagged, and pushed to fork (`motion2082/obsidian-rss-dashboard`).
- Release workflow updated: removed `--draft` flag, added `motion` tag pattern to prerelease regex.
- Install via BRAT: `motion2082/obsidian-rss-dashboard`.

## 2026-03-14 — Session 7: YouTube GUID Fix, Reddit Card Summaries, BRAT Release

### YouTube Feed Refresh GUID Mismatch (CRITICAL FIX)
- **Problem**: YouTube feeds would stop updating after first import. Deleting and re-adding the feed was the only way to get new items. Root cause: `convertToAbsoluteUrl()` was applied to YouTube `yt:video:VIDEO_ID` guids during refresh, mangling them into malformed URLs like `https://youtube.com/feeds/...yt:video:xyz`. The mangled guid never matched the stored guid, so every item appeared "new" on every refresh — causing duplicates, lost read/starred state, and eventually stale feeds.
- **Fix (feed-parser.ts)**: Skip `convertToAbsoluteUrl()` for guids that don't start with `http`. Applied in both the incoming-item lookup (line ~2176) and the existing-item retention loop (line ~2286).

### Reddit/RSS Cards Showing Blank Space
- **Problem**: Reddit feed cards showed title and feed name but large blank areas — no description preview. Two causes: (1) `article.summary` wasn't being used as fallback when no cover image existed; (2) Reddit RSS content contains `<img>` tags that extract as cover images, but the Reddit preview URLs fail to load — and the `onerror` handler removed the entire cover container including the summary overlay.
- **Fix (article-list.ts)**: Added `stripHtmlToText()` helper that strips HTML and truncates to 220 chars. Card renderer now falls back to generating summary from `description`/`content` at render time. Image `onerror` handler now replaces the failed cover container with a summary-only block instead of removing it entirely.

### Version Bump & BRAT Release
- **Version**: `2.2.0-motion.1` — fork identifier for BRAT distribution
- **Release workflow**: Removed `--draft` flag so GitHub releases are published automatically (BRAT requires non-draft releases). Added `motion` tag pattern to prerelease regex.
- **Deploy**: Tag `2.2.0-motion.1` pushed to `motion2082/obsidian-rss-dashboard`

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/services/feed-parser.ts` | GUID mismatch fix: skip URL conversion for non-URL guids |
| `src/components/article-list.ts` | `stripHtmlToText()` helper; render-time summary fallback; image error → summary replacement |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Remove `--draft`, add `motion` tag to prerelease regex |
| `manifest.json` | Version bump to `2.2.0-motion.1` |
| `versions.json` | Add `2.2.0-motion.1` entry |

## 2026-03-12 — Session 5: YouTube RSS Outage, Proxy Cleanup, Save & Open UX

### YouTube RSS Feeds Returning 404
- **Problem**: All YouTube channels returning "Error loading feed" / "Request failed, status 404". YouTube's `/feeds/videos.xml` endpoint is globally returning 404 — not a plugin bug.
- **Fix (feed-manager-modal.ts)**: Both Add and Edit feed modals now route YouTube URLs through `parseFeed()` which tries the YouTube Data API v3 first (when an API key is configured), then falls back to RSS. When RSS fails and no API key is set, status shows: "YouTube RSS is unavailable. Add a YouTube API key in plugin settings."
- **Fix (feed-parser.ts)**: `parseYouTubeFeedViaApi()` now extracts channel title from the first API item (`snippet.channelTitle`) instead of defaulting to "YouTube Feed".

### YouTube Handle Case Sensitivity
- **Problem**: `@AIDailyBrief` (mixed case) failed while `@aidailybrief` (lowercase) worked — YouTube handles are case-sensitive in URL resolution.
- **Fix (media-service.ts)**: Handle is now lowercased before the channel page fetch.

### Dead CORS Proxy Cleanup
- **Problem**: CORS proxy fallback chain had dead services flooding the console with errors: isomorphic-git (403), thingproxy (DNS dead).
- **Fix (feed-parser.ts)**: Removed isomorphic-git and thingproxy from the proxy cascade. Chain is now: direct fetch → AllOrigins (get/raw) → codetabs → feed discovery.

### Improved Error Reporting in Feed Modals
- **Problem**: Both Add and Edit feed modals showed generic "Error loading feed" for all failures.
- **Fix (feed-manager-modal.ts)**: Catch blocks now show the actual error message (e.g. "Request failed, status 404", "Could not resolve YouTube channel ID").

### Save & Open Replaces Reader View In-Place
- **Problem**: "Save & Open" opened the saved note in a new tab, leaving the RSS Dashboard and reader still occupying screen space.
- **Fix (reader-view.ts)**: `openSavedNote()` now uses `this.leaf.openFile(file)` to open the saved note in the same pane as the reader, replacing it.
- **Fix (dashboard-view.ts)**: `openSavedArticleFile()` now checks for an existing reader view leaf and reuses it, instead of always creating a new split.

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/services/feed-parser.ts` | Removed dead proxies (isomorphic-git, thingproxy); channel title from API items |
| `src/services/media-service.ts` | Lowercase YouTube handles before fetch |
| `src/modals/feed-manager-modal.ts` | YouTube API path in Load button; actual error messages in status |
| `src/views/reader-view.ts` | `openSavedNote()` opens in same leaf instead of new tab |
| `src/views/dashboard-view.ts` | `openSavedArticleFile()` reuses reader leaf if available |

---

## 2026-03-11 — Session 4: YouTube Template Variables, Open After Save

### Extended Template Variables for Media
- **Problem**: Save templates only supported basic variables (`{{title}}`, `{{content}}`, `{{link}}`, etc.), making them useless for YouTube videos where users need embed URLs, channel names, durations, thumbnails, etc.
- **Fix (article-saver.ts)**: Added 9 new template variables to both `applyTemplate()` and `generateFrontmatter()`:
  - `{{videoId}}` — YouTube video ID
  - `{{embedUrl}}` — `https://www.youtube.com/embed/{videoId}`
  - `{{videoUrl}}` — watch URL (from item or constructed from videoId)
  - `{{channelName}}` — feed title (alias for `{{feedTitle}}`)
  - `{{duration}}` — duration from RSS feed
  - `{{publishDate}}` — ISO pub date (alias for `{{isoDate}}`)
  - `{{coverImage}}` — thumbnail/cover image URL
  - `{{description}}` — raw description text
  - `{{mediaType}}` — article/video/podcast
  - `{{audioUrl}}` — podcast audio URL
- **Use case**: Users can now create YouTube save presets that mirror Obsidian Web Clipper templates, with Templater `<% %>` syntax processed via existing integration.

### Open Note After Save
- **Problem**: After saving an article/video, users had to manually navigate to the saved note to review or edit it.
- **Fix (reader-view.ts)**: Added `openSavedNote()` method that opens the saved file in a new tab. Called from all three save paths: default save, preset save, and custom folder save.
- **Setting (types.ts, settings-tab.ts)**: Added `openAfterSave` boolean to `ArticleSavingSettings` with toggle in Article Saving settings. Currently hardcoded to always open (setting exists for future toggle).

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/services/article-saver.ts` | 9 new template variables in `applyTemplate()` and `generateFrontmatter()` |
| `src/views/reader-view.ts` | `openSavedNote()` method, wired into all save paths, `TFile` import |
| `src/types/types.ts` | `openAfterSave` in `ArticleSavingSettings` and `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` |
| `src/settings/settings-tab.ts` | "Open note after saving" toggle in article saving settings |

## 2026-03-10 — Session 3: Save Presets, Templater, UI Fixes

### Card Spacing Slider Crashes Menu
- **Problem**: Adjusting the card spacing slider (or cards/row buttons) closed the controls dropdown.
- **Root cause**: `handleCardSpacingChange()` and `handleCardColumnsChange()` in dashboard-view.ts called `this.render()`, which destroyed and rebuilt the entire view including the open dropdown.
- **Fix (dashboard-view.ts)**: Both handlers now directly update the grid element's inline `gap` / `grid-template-columns` style via `querySelector()` instead of re-rendering.

### Search Icon Overlaps Placeholder Text
- **Problem**: The magnifying glass icon in the controls dropdown covered the "Search articles..." placeholder text.
- **Fix (dropdown-portal.css)**: Increased search input left padding from 34px to 38px.

### Sidebar Badge Bleed-Through When Collapsed
- **Problem**: Unread count badges (circles with numbers) were visible when the sidebar was collapsed/hidden.
- **Root cause**: Sidebar is 280px wide but was only translated -250px, leaving 30px visible where badges showed.
- **Fix (layout.css, sidebar.css)**: Changed `translateX(-250px)` to `translateX(-100%)` so the sidebar fully slides off-screen regardless of width.

### YouTube Video Description — Broken HTML
- **Problem**: Opening a YouTube video showed raw `<body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">` text in the description.
- **Root cause (video-player.ts)**: `XMLSerializer().serializeToString(doc.body)` wrapped output in `<body xmlns=...>`, then `.textContent =` displayed it as literal text.
- **Fix (video-player.ts)**: Replaced with DOM node adoption (`document.adoptNode()`) — no serialization needed.

### YouTube Description — Collapsible + Formatted
- **Problem**: YouTube descriptions were a wall of unformatted text.
- **Fix (video-player.ts, video.css)**: Description is now a collapsible `<details>` toggle. Plain-text URLs are auto-converted to clickable links. Line breaks preserved. Styled with border, background, and scroll overflow.

### Save Presets Feature
- **Problem**: Users could only save with one default folder/template, no way to define multiple folder+template combos.
- **Implementation**:
  - **types.ts**: Added `folder` field to `SavedTemplate`, added `defaultPresetId` to `ArticleSavingSettings`
  - **main.ts**: Migration backfills `folder: ""` on existing saved templates
  - **settings-tab.ts**: "Saved templates" → "Save presets" with folder per preset, default preset dropdown, Edit modal (name + folder + template body)
  - **reader-view.ts**: Right-click save menu lists all presets ("Save with [Name]"), custom save modal has preset dropdown that auto-fills folder + template
  - **dashboard-view.ts**: `handleArticleSave()` resolves preset folder+template (feed-level → default preset → global defaults)
  - **feed-manager-modal.ts**: Template dropdown renamed to "Save preset" with folder shown in label

### Templater Integration
- **Problem**: Templater `<% ... %>` syntax in templates wasn't processed — files created via `vault.create()` don't trigger Templater automatically.
- **Fix (article-saver.ts)**: After saving, calls Templater's `overwrite_file_commands()` API on the new file if the plugin is installed.

## 2026-03-08 — Session 1: YouTube Fixes, UI Enhancements, Dropdown Port

### YouTube Channel URL Handling
- **Problem**: Adding feeds with YouTube handle URLs (e.g. `https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisTitusTech`) failed with "Not a valid RSS/Atom feed"
- **Root cause**: `addFeed()` passed raw YouTube URLs directly to `parseFeed()` which expected RSS XML. The single regex for channel ID extraction also failed on modern YouTube page HTML.
- **Fix (media-service.ts)**: Expanded channel ID extraction from 1 regex to 8 patterns (`channelId`, `channel_id`, `externalId`, `data-channel-external-id`, `/channel/` URL, `<meta>` tag, `<link>` tag, `browseId`). Applied same multi-pattern approach to `/c/` URL handler.
- **Fix (main.ts)**: Added YouTube URL auto-detection at top of `addFeed()` — converts handle/channel URLs to RSS feed URLs before proceeding.
- **Fix (feed-parser.ts)**: Added same auto-conversion in `parseFeed()` for existing feeds saved with raw YouTube URLs, so refreshing also works. Updates `existingFeed.url` to the resolved RSS URL.

### XDA Feed Cover Images
- **Problem**: XDA Developers feed articles had no cover images despite having `<enclosure type="image/jpeg">` tags in the RSS XML.
- **Fix (feed-parser.ts)**: Added `enclosure?.type?.startsWith('image/')` check to the cover image extraction chain for both new and existing items.

### Card Hover Fix
- **Problem**: Hovering over video cards (which have no summary text) made the thumbnail go grey/invisible.
- **Root cause**: Duplicate CSS rule in `card-view.css` lines 142-148 was missing `.has-summary` qualifier, causing ALL cards' cover images to fade on hover.
- **Fix (card-view.css)**: Added `.has-summary` qualifier so only cards with summary text show the hover overlay effect.

### Card Height Fix
- **Problem**: Video cards had large empty space between content and action toolbar.
- **Root cause**: Cards had fixed `min-height: 360px; max-height: 360px` — video cards with less content didn't fill the space.
- **Fix (card-view.css)**: Removed fixed height constraints, set `min-height: 0` so cards size naturally.

### Folder Suggest — "Add New Folder"
- **Problem**: The FolderSuggest dropdown in Edit Feed/Add Feed modals didn't allow creating new folders.
- **Fix (folder-suggest.ts)**: Added `ADD_FOLDER_SENTINEL` item to dropdown, `showAddFolderPrompt()` modal with input field, and `onAddFolder` callback. New folders are added to `sourceFolders` and persisted via callback.

### Vault Image Suggest for Cover Images
- **Problem**: Default cover image fields required typing full vault paths manually.
- **Fix (folder-suggest.ts)**: Added `VaultImageSuggest` class — autocomplete for image files (png, jpg, gif, svg, webp, etc.) from the vault, limited to 50 results.
- **Wired into**: Edit Feed modal (`feed-manager-modal.ts`) and Global fallback setting (`settings-tab.ts`).

### Per-Feed and Global Fallback Cover Images
- **Problem**: Feeds like Reddit often lack article images, leaving cards with no cover.
- **Fix (types.ts)**: Added `defaultCoverImage` to `Feed` interface and `globalFallbackCoverImage` to `DisplaySettings`.
- **Fix (article-list.ts)**: Added fallback chain: per-feed `defaultCoverImage` → global `globalFallbackCoverImage`. Uses `app.vault.adapter.getResourcePath()` to convert vault paths to renderable URLs.
- **Fix (feed-manager-modal.ts)**: Added "Default cover image" text field with VaultImageSuggest.
- **Fix (settings-tab.ts)**: Added "Global fallback cover image" setting with VaultImageSuggest.

### SQLite → data.json Migration
- **Discovery**: The installed plugin (v2.2.0-beta.3 from [amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard](https://github.com/amatya-aditya/obsidian-rss-dashboard)) uses SQLite for storage. Our repo uses Obsidian's `loadData`/`saveData` (data.json). Deploying our main.js wiped the feeds.
- **Fix**: Python script exported 16 feeds + 237 articles from `rss-dashboard.sqlite` into `data.json` format. Feed data preserved.
- **Note**: The installed plugin at `D:\Obsidian Resources\Demo Vaults\Pauls Content\.obsidian\plugins\rss-dashboard\` has the original backup.

### Dropdown UI Port (Filter Panel + Hamburger Controls)
- **Problem**: Our repo had a simple flat toolbar; the installed v2.2.0-beta.3 had dropdown filter panel and hamburger controls menu.
- **Implementation (article-list.ts)**:
  - Replaced flat toolbar with Filter trigger button + Hamburger menu button
  - Filter panel: fixed-positioned portal on document.body with And/Or toggle, status filter checkboxes (Unread/Read/Saved/Starred/Podcast/Videos/Tagged with icons), Show Status Bar, Bypass All Filters, Show Highlights toggles, Apply button
  - Hamburger dropdown: search input with icon/clear, Age/Sort/Grouping selects with icons, List/Card toggle with icons, Refresh button, Cards/row selector (Auto, 1-6), Card spacing slider (0-40px), Mark all Read/Unread buttons
- **New types (types.ts)**: `StatusFilters`, `HighlightsSettings` interfaces; `cardColumnsPerRow`, `cardSpacing` in DisplaySettings; `filterLogic`, `statusFilters`, `showFilterStatusBar`, `bypassAllFilters`, `highlights` in settings
- **New callbacks (article-list.ts)**: `onSearchChange`, `onStatusFiltersChange`, `onShowFilterStatusBarChange`, `onBypassAllFiltersChange`, `onHighlightsChange`, `onCardColumnsChange`, `onCardSpacingChange`, `onMarkAllRead`, `onMarkAllUnread`
- **Wired up (dashboard-view.ts)**: All new callbacks connected to handler methods
- **CSS (dropdown-portal.css)**: Full styling for filter portal, hamburger dropdown, all controls
- **Status**: Builds successfully, deployed but **untested**

## 2026-03-09 — Session 2: Card/List UI Polish, Feed Modal Fixes, YouTube Channel ID

### Card View — Bottom Spacing Fix
- **Problem**: Cards had extra empty space at the bottom in card view.
- **Root cause**: `responsive.css` had fixed `min-height`/`max-height` constraints on `.rss-dashboard-article-card` at every `@media`, `@container`, and mobile breakpoint (75 lines across 35 blocks).
- **Fix (responsive.css)**: Removed all fixed card height constraints from responsive breakpoints. Cards now size naturally based on content.

### Card View — Equal Row Heights
- **Problem**: Cards in the same row had different heights.
- **Root cause**: `.rss-dashboard-card-view` had `align-items: start` which prevented CSS Grid's default stretch behavior.
- **Fix (card-view.css)**: Removed `align-items: start` from grid container, allowing default `stretch` so cards in each row match the tallest card's height.

### List View — Full-Width Layout
- **Problem**: List view items were center-aligned with `max-width: 800px`, wasting horizontal space.
- **Fix (articles.css)**: Removed `margin: auto; width: -webkit-fill-available; max-width: 800px` from `.rss-dashboard-article-item`, replaced with `width: 100%`.

### Date Truncation Fix
- **Problem**: Dates in both card and list views were being cut off (showing only time, not full date).
- **Fix (articles.css)**: Changed `.rss-dashboard-article-date` from `overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis` to `white-space: nowrap; flex-shrink: 0`.

### Podcast Cover Images
- **Problem**: Podcast feeds (e.g., Theo Von) weren't showing cover images on cards.
- **Root cause**: Feed parser's cover image deduplication logic was stripping images that matched the feed's logo when they appeared in >= 80% of items. For podcasts, the show art IS the intended image for every episode.
- **Fix (feed-parser.ts)**: Added `MediaService.isPodcastFeed()` check to skip the deduplication logic for podcast feeds.

### Card Spacing & Columns Not Applied
- **Problem**: Card spacing slider and cards/row buttons saved settings but had no visual effect.
- **Root cause**: `handleCardSpacingChange()` and `handleCardColumnsChange()` saved to `settings.display` and called `render()`, but the grid container never applied these values as inline styles — it always used the hardcoded CSS `gap: 15px`.
- **Fix (article-list.ts)**: In `renderArticles()`, after creating the card view container, apply `cardSpacing` as `gap` and `cardColumnsPerRow` as `grid-template-columns` inline styles.

### YouTube Title Detection in Add/Edit Feed Modal
- **Problem**: Clicking "Load" on a YouTube channel URL (e.g., `@aiexplained-official`) showed no title — the Title field stayed empty.
- **Root cause**: The Load button fetched the raw YouTube URL and parsed it as `text/xml`. YouTube pages are HTML, not XML, so `querySelector("channel > title")` found nothing.
- **Fix (feed-manager-modal.ts)**: Import `MediaService` and convert YouTube URLs to RSS feed URLs via `MediaService.getYouTubeRssFeed()` before fetching. Applied to both `AddFeedModal` and `EditFeedModal` Load buttons.

### Folder Input UX
- **Problem**: To select a folder in Add/Edit Feed modal, users had to manually delete existing text before the dropdown would filter properly.
- **Fix (feed-manager-modal.ts)**: Added `folderInput.addEventListener("focus", () => folderInput.select())` to both AddFeedModal and EditFeedModal folder inputs. Now clicking the field auto-selects all text for immediate typing/replacement.

### YouTube Channel ID Extraction — Wrong Channel
- **Problem**: Adding `@Hardwareunboxed` resolved to "Monitors Unboxed" instead of "Hardware Unboxed".
- **Root cause**: The first regex pattern `channelId":` matched the first channel ID in YouTube's HTML, which could be a related/secondary channel listed before the page owner's ID.
- **Fix (media-service.ts)**: Reordered extraction patterns to prioritize canonical/meta tags that identify the page owner:
  1. `<meta itemprop="channelId">` (most reliable)
  2. `<link rel="canonical">` (canonical URL)
  3. Other `<meta>` and `<link>` tags
  4. Generic JSON patterns as fallback

### Files Modified
